## üõ† Design Decisions

1. **Class-Based Views (CBVs)**
   - All views implemented as CBVs for cleaner, reusable, and organized code.

2. **Approval Workflow**
   - New posts are hidden from public view until approved by a moderator.
   - Implemented via a boolean `approved` field in models.

3. **Flagging System**
   - Built using a generic relation (`content_type` + `object_id`) so both questions and answers can be flagged.

4. **Minimal UI**
   - Used Bootstrap for simplicity, responsiveness, and consistent styling.

5. **Search**
   - Implemented with Django ORM filtering ‚Äî no external dependencies required.

6. **View Count Tracking**
   - Each time a question is viewed, a counter is incremented in the detail view.
